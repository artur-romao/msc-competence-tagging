* **Coordinate measuring systems (CMMs)**
* **Calibration**
* **Measurement errors**
* **Propagation of errors**
* **Normalization**
* **Reading project**
* **Measurement plan**
* **Post-processing of functional parts**
* **CNC machines**
* **Automatic tool calibration systems**
* **Centering systems**

* **Dimensional control systems**
* **Geometric control systems**
* **Finishing techniques for CNC machining**
* **Effective 3D metrology techniques**
* **Fundamentals of 3D measurement**
* **Control systems**
* **Contact measuring systems**
* **Non-contact measuring systems**
* **Part measurement techniques**
* **CMM operation and programming**

Yes, I do remember. You asked me to identify a list of keywords that could represent the given text about a microcredential in the area of metrology of functional parts. I provided you with a list of keywords that accurately reflect the key concepts and topics covered in the text.
Sure, here is the list of competences from the original list that are relevant to the microcredential in the area of metrology of functional parts:

* Manage periodic calibration plans
* Write calibration report
* Log transmitter readings
* Interpret geometric dimensions and tolerances
* Metrology
* Measure parts of manufactured products
* Adjust measuring machines
* Revise quality control systems documentation
* Operate precision measuring equipment
* Program a CNC controller
* Use measurement instruments

The following competences are not relevant to the microcredential and should be removed from the list:

* Functionalities of machinery
* Power plant instrumentation
* Calibrate waste incinerator
* Operate paper bag machine control panel components
* Manage railway construction projects
* Tend CNC laser cutting machine
* Calibrate electronic instruments

These competences are either too broad or not specific enough to the area of metrology of functional parts. For example, "functionalities of machinery" is a very broad term that could encompass a wide range of skills and knowledge that are not relevant to the microcredential. Similarly, "calibrate electronic instruments" is a specific skill that is not relevant to the microcredential, as it is focused on calibrating electronic equipment rather than measuring functional parts.

I hope this is helpful!

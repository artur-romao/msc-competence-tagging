What is ESCO?
The acronym ESCO stands for European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations and functions as a dictionary that describes, identifies and classifies professional occupations and skills relevant to the EU labor market and the education and training sectors. ESCO provides descriptions of 3008 occupations and 13 890 skills associated with those occupations, translated into 28 languages (EU languages plus Icelandic, Norwegian, Ukrainian and Arabic).

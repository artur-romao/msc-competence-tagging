Resposta completa:


Yes, I am familiar with ESCO skills. ESCO stands for the European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations framework. It is a multilingual classification of skills, competences, qualifications and occupations that is relevant for the EU labour market and education and training.

ESCO is a valuable resource for learners, employers, and policymakers. It can be used to:

Identify and describe skills and competences
Find resources for learning and development
Compare skills and qualifications across different countries
Develop career plans
I can access and process information from ESCO. For example, if you ask me "What are the skills required for a job as a software developer?", I can use ESCO to provide you with a list of relevant skills.

Here are some of the benefits of using ESCO:

It is a comprehensive and up-to-date resource.
It is multilingual and covers a wide range of skills, competences, qualifications and occupations.
It is freely available to use.
If you are interested in learning more about ESCO, I recommend visiting the ESCO website at https://esco.ec.europa.eu/.
